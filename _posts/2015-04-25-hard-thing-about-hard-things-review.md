###Synopsis
[The Hard Thing About Hard Things](http://www.amazon.com/The-Hard-Thing-About-Things/dp/0062273205): A long running blog by VC [Ben Horowitz](http://www.bhorowitz.com/) is condensed into a book that flows... like a series of blog posts. Along with credibility-forming war stories, he covers advice on areas such as fund-raising, management, hiring executives, and dealing with rapid growth from an organizational perspective.

Many pieces of advice are delivered as 'the right way' to do things. If you take these with a grain of salt and add the parts that jive well with you to your particular manager-toolbox,  it's definitely worth a read.

###B/B-

Who should read it

- People looking for startup war stories from the early 2000's
- Connoisseurs of hip hop/MBA crossover fiction
- Early career CEOs or managers looking for a more aggressive  perspective on startup mechanics


###Non-comprehensive interesting bullet points


> "If you're going to eat shit don't nibble"
> -- On dealing with bad situations with full solutions


Add "What are we not doing?" as an agenda item to a monthly meeting

#####Management Debt

Short term fixes that need to get paid off later:

- Dual promoting two peers
- Overcompensating an employee with another offer
- Lack of performance management / employee feedback processes


#####Being a good company

> "Being a good company doesn't matter when things go well, but it can be the difference between life and death when things go wrong" - On being more than a place to get a salary and resume boost

Reasons to stay put:

- wide open career path at a growing company
- great resume fodder
- options to vest and get rich from

When the company goes south, those ALL fail. The only thing that can keep an employee at a place where things went wrong is that she likes her job.

That last point is particularly interesting to me: slice away your company's perks. Do people still want to work there? What's the core that's not ping pong and health insurance?

#####Culture vs. perks

Perks are not culture. Culture ties back to your business: Amazon saves people money, and so started with doors for desks. Square is design focused. Their office is architecturally impressive. [A16Z](http://a16z.com/) is entrepreneur focused, so they pay out $10 / minute when they're late for meetings.

Culture is *shared beliefs*, not things you buy for employees.


#####Screening hires

Look out for people with two types of subtly different ambition: those wanting company success, then theirs as a byproduct vs. theirs first regardless of company outcome. Will they care or feel responsible if your company goes under?

Company size is important when hiring: don't overshoot and get a 'big' VP of xxxxx before you need it. They might not be effective without the scaffolding of a big company around them.

Hire for strength, not lack of weaknesses.

#####Politics due to lack of structure

Politics show up when you're not strict and following process on:

- Performance evaluation and compensation
- Organization design / territory
- Promotions

Be strict on those and you can avoid (a lot of) politicking.

#####Training

Train a team on your expectations. So easy. No one does it. Good product manager / bad product manager (extends to developers too, [see mine here](https://gist.github.com/alexmcpherson/e414f92976f90e6a46a9))

- Training yields career growth and happiness
- Training yields a crystal clear baseline for performance measurement
- Training keeps the product quality up
