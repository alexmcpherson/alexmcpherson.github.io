This was one of the first editions of a now <a href=" http://environmentsforhumans.com/2012/javascript-summit/" target="_blank">well established online conference</a>. I spoke alongside some big names in the JavaScript community including <a href="http://www.nczonline.net/" title="Nicholas Zakas" target="_blank">Nicholas Zakas</a>, <a href="http://rmurphey.com/" title="Rebecca Murphey" target="_blank">Rebecca Murphey</a>, <a href="http://benalman.com/" title="Ben Alman" target="_blank">Ben Alman</a>, and <a href="http://addyosmani.com/" title="Addy Osmani" target="_blank">Addy Osmani</a> (among many other excellent speakers).

I gave a refined and more up-to-date version of my promises and deferreds talk, and it was very well received. It was a good experience to have done a fully online conference talk, and in the future I would get set up with a better microphone and a second screen to see comments as they come in.
